<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Interpolation Models</h1>
<p>This tutorial demonstrates how to compare common interpolation models empirically to select the one that seems most appropriate for a given spatial extent. It follows the steps provided in an R-Spatial <a href="https://rspatial.org/raster/analysis/4-interpolation.html#calfornia-air-pollution-data">tutorial</a> on interpolating pollution vairables. Possible interpolation models are voronoi polygons, nearest neighbor interpolation, inverse distance weights (IDW), and finally kriging. The oprimal model is one with the lowest RMSE compared to all other models. The models are also evaluated against a “NULL Model”, where the mean value is assigned in all grid cells.</p>

<p>Overall the interpolation yield provdes a similar estimate of temperature as the voronoi polygons. This is expected as voronoi polygons are a form of nearest neighbor interpolation. The differenc here is that this mode takes into account the temperature values at the five nearest sensors, not just one nearest sensor.</p>
<p>Cross validating the result using the <code>gstat</code> <code>predict()</code> function.</p>

<p>The average RMSE after 5-fold cross validation is 1.80. This model is 14% more accurate than the null model. This suggests that it might be a less effective estimate of temperature in our case.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.6</span> Model 3: IDW Interpolation using baseline parameters</h2>
<p>IDW stands for Inverse Distance Weighted interpolation. This model estimates temperature at a given cell by taking into account temperature values located at various nearby sensors and each sensor’s straight line distance to the grid cell. Data from sensors located closer to the target grid cell are given more weight in the final estimate of temperature in that cell. This model is a logical outcropping of Tobler’s first law of geography, “everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.”</p>

<p>The IDW model creates a smoother temperature surface compared to voronoi polygons and nearest neighbor interpolations. Hard breaks between individual sensor regions is reduced to a minimum. However, IDW also introduced it’s own distortion. The ‘bullseye’ effect occurs when a sensor value is significantly different than the rest, an artefact that is clearly visible around almost all snesor locations in our map.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.7</span> Model 4: Optimized IDW Interpolation</h2>
<p>IDW models are highly sensitive to two user defined parameters. 1) The maximum number of sensors to take into account and 2) a decay or friction of distance parameter. Since models are evaluated using RMSE, an optimization algorithm can be used to find an optimal number of sensors and decay parameter that minimizes RMSE. This optimization is performed below.</p>

<p>The optimal IDW interpolation can be gleaned from the <code>opt$par</code> variable. The number of sensors to consider should be ~4.90 while the decay parameter should be 8.44.</p>
<p>Performing the IDW interpolation with these parameters yields the following results.</p>

<p>The output from this model is super interesting. It looks similar to the voronoi polygons, but as if someone took a paintbrush to the edges of each polygon and mixed the colors together. In scientific terms, it’s as if someone took the voronoi polygons and added a thin gradient between each polygon.</p>
<p>Let’s cross validate and get the RMSE</p>

<p>We notice that the improvements of each model is highly variable depending on the model chosen. Kriging has the highest performance, with a 66% improvement over the null model.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.11</span> Conclusion</h2>
<p>The highest performing model is the ordinary kriging interpolation, with a 65% improvement over the null model. The worst performance came from the nearest neighbor interpolation, with only 14% improvement. The Voronoi, Optimized IDW, and Thin Plate Spline were solidly in the middle of the pack with improvement between 23% and 36%. These values give us a great point estimate of each model’s performance, however we made no effort to show that the differences in improvement (i.e. RMSE) are statistically significant. Selecting which model to use requires more sensor locations and some basic hypothesis testing.</p>
