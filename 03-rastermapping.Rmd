# Raster Data Mapping

## Introduction

This part will introduce you to <describe original raster datasets here>

## Environment Setup

The follow packages must be installed on your computer before proceeding.

* `tmap`: flexible thematic mapping 
* <other packages as needed>

`tmap` will be set to interactive mode for this tutorial.

Let's library the above packages. We also set `view` mode in `tmap` to create interactive and clickable maps.

```{r message=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
library(tmap)
tmap_mode('view')
```
